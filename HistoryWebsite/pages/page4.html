      <h2>Event Details</h2>
      <p>This event marked a significant shift in the approach to resolving the territorial dispute.
        Guatemala decided to suspend the planned October 6th simultaneous referenda on submitting the issue to the ICJ.
        Instead, they opted to unilaterally take the dispute to the International Court of Justice for final adjudication.
        This decision came as a surprise and potentially altered the course of negotiations between the two countries.</p>
