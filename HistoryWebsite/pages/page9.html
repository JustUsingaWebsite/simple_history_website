      <p>“Fund for Peace: Peaceful Settlement of
        Territorial Disputes,” the General Assembly established a mechanism for providing member <br>
        states of the Organization, that so request, with financial resources to assist with defraying <br>
        the costs of proceedings previously agreed to by the parties for the peaceful settlement of <br>
        territorial disputes among member states. The Peace Fund, as it is most commonly known, is <br>
        also a mechanism through which the Parties in dispute can avail themselves of a range of <br>
        conflict resolution mechanisms contemplated under the OAS Charter and the Pact of Bogota, <br>
        such as mediation, facilitation, direct negotiation, good offices, arbitration, investigation and <br>
        judicial settlement, among others. </p>
